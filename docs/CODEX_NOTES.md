# Codex Notes (Living)

## Working rules
- Implement exactly what is specified in `gates/` and `spec/`.
- Prefer refusal when ambiguous.
- Do not add new fields to the trace without explicit version bump.
- Do not tune thresholds or add predictive indicators.

## Current task
Create a minimal replay harness that emits schema-compliant JSONL records.
